## Neural Network Training

Embarked on a dynamic initiative to develop a Neural Network Training system, currently in progress.
The project entails the training of a flexible multi-layer neural network, featuring customizable parameters.


## Skills Demonstrated in the Project

- Python Programming
- Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Numerical Computing with NumPy
- Project Management and Development


## Project Structure

- training_neural_network:
This Python script serves as the core of the project, implementing the training process for a neural network.

- test_script:
A Python script designed to assess the performance of the `training_neural_network` script across different datasets and hyperparameters. The script should systematically test various hyperparameter configurations on each provided dataset and determine the optimal settings for the given datasets.


## Future implementations

- Validation set
- Seperate the training set to mini-batches
-
